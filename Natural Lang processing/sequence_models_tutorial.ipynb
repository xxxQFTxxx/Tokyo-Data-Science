    "models where there is some sort of dependence through time between your\n",

    "A recurrent neural network is a network that maintains some kind of\n",
    "state. For example, its output could be used as part of the next input,\n",
    "so that information can propagate along as the network passes over the\n",
    "sequence. In the case of an LSTM, for each element in the sequence,\n",
    "there is a corresponding *hidden state* $h_t$, which in principle\n",

    "all of its inputs to be 3D tensors. The semantics of the axes of these\n",
    "tensors is important. The first axis is the sequence itself, the second\n",
    "indexes instances in the mini-batch, and the third indexes elements of\n",
    "the input. We haven't discussed mini-batching, so let us just ignore that\n",
    "and assume we will always have just 1 dimension on the second axis. If\n",
